          Hi! I'm a passionate web developer with a love for creating beautiful and functional websites.
          With experience in React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I strive to build responsive and user-friendly web applications.

          My journey in web development started with a curiosity about how websites work, and over the years, I've developed a keen eye for design and a strong understanding of coding principles.
          I'm constantly learning new technologies and looking for new challenges to improve my skills.
